# GlucoseGuardian_AI

**Because blood sugar doesn’t control me – I control it.**

This is a high-level Python project developed by [JimmyTheBeast7], built to analyze and visualize blood glucose levels from real-life data using `pandas` and `matplotlib`.  
It’s more than just code – it’s a war machine for diabetes management.

## Features

- Reads glucose data from `glucose_data.csv`
- Parses and sorts the data by timestamp
- Calculates:
  - Basic statistics (mean, std, min, max)
- Plots a clean glucose-over-time graph

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`

Install with:
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib
